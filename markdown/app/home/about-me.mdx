I am a passionate UX/UI Designer, driven by a love for innovation and creativity. With a diverse skill set in web design, interaction design, and user research, I aim to push boundaries and craft meaningful experiences. 

My journey has taken me through leading design projects for Fortune 500 companies, where I honed my skills in design thinking and user-centered solutions. I believe in constant growth, whether it's by leading projects or exploring new technologies. When Iâ€™m not working on my next big idea, you can find me experimenting with photography or learning new design tools.
