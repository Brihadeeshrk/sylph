## Innovator, Visionary, Creator

Co-founder of Apple and a believer in the power of technology to change the world. My passion has always been to create products that blend form and function, with design that makes people’s lives simpler, more intuitive, and beautiful. From the first Macintosh to the iPhone, I’ve pushed the boundaries of what’s possible, always striving for perfection and innovation.

At the core of my work is a simple philosophy: make things that people will love. Technology should feel natural, almost invisible, while empowering the user. It’s not about being the first—it’s about being the best, and focusing on what truly matters. That’s how we changed industries, from computers to music to mobile phones, and how we continue to think differently.
