# Experience

Most people don’t get the wonderful experiences because they never ask. I have never found anybody that didn’t want to help me if I asked them for help. I have never found anyone who said no and hung up the phone when I called.

Most people never pick up the phone and call, most people never ask and that’s what seperates sometimes the people who do things and the people who just dream about them.

You got to act. You got to be willing to fail. Willing to crash and burn. If you are afraid of failing you won’t get very far.

# Start Young

I started Apple when I was 20, Woz was maybe 24 or 25. We had no families, no children, no houses. We had nothing to lose and everything to again. And we figured, even if we crash and burn and lose everything, the experience will have been 10 times the cost. There was no risk.

The only thing really you have in your life is time and if you invest that time in yourself to have great experiences that are going to enrich you then you can’t possibly lose. So, I always advice people don’t wait. Do something when you are young when you have nothing to lose. Not that people can’t start them when they are 50. I have seen that and there are very successful companies. But it’s lot easier when you are young, you don’t have anything to lose and no don’t have responsibilities to other people that you will acquire later in life.

# Passion

All that work that I have done in my life will be obsolete by the time I am 50. This is a field where one does not write principia which hold up for 200 years, or one paints a painting that will be looked for several centuries or build a church that will be admired and look in astonishment for centuries. This is field where things become obsolete for 10 years. You can’t go back and use Apple I. It’s sort of like sediments of rock where you are building up a mountain and you get to contribute your layer of sedimentary rock to make the mountain much higher. No one on surface will have be able to see your sediment unless they have X-ray vision, they will stand on it.

If you want to want what is going to happen in 5 years, you don’t look in mainstream, you look at fringe.

You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
