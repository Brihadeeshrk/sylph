##  overview
- project and programs
- proj mgmt
- proj lifecycle
- PMBOK, PRINCE2 and agile
- proj team

## what is a proj
- a temp endeavor undertaken to create a unique prod, service or result (ACCORDING TO PMI) - proj mgmt institute which is an inst in the US that develops a std called PMBOK
- a project is finite, has a start and end date
- has a budget, and goals and the aim is to introduce some change in an org
- comparison with routine day to day work
	-  ROUTINE WORK
		- taking notes in class
		- entering sales receipts into a ledger (data entry)
		- responding to a supply chain req
		- practising an instrument
		- manufacturing of a device
	- PROJECT
		- writing a sem end
		- setting up a sales kiosk for a prof accounting meeting
		- developing a supply chain info system
		- writing a new song for an instrument
		- designing a new device

## proj lifecycle
- PROJECT LIFECYCLE- is a visual representation of the work that gets done through out the life of the proj
	- there are diff stages that can be generalised
	- defining
		- goals, specs, tasks, responsibilities
	- planning (more formal planning)
		- schedules, budgets, resources, risks, staffing, contingency plans etc
	- executing
		- status reports, manage changes, updates on proj quality, forecasts
	- closing
		- train the customer, transfer docs, release resources, eval, lessons learned

## program vs proj
- program - a group of related projects designed to accomplish a common goal over an extended period of time
- program mgmt - the process of managing a group of onngoing, interdependant, related projs in a cooridnated way to achieve strategic objs
- project manager - the person who runs the project, a lot of admin
	- manages temp, nonrepetitive activities and frequently acts independently of the formal org
	- marshals the resources for the proj
	- direct link tot he customer
	- works with a diverse troupe of characters
	- provides direction, coordination, and integration to the project team
	- is responsible for performance, and success of the poject
	- must induce the right people at the right time
- the role of a project manager can be divided into 2 roles
	- the technical dimension (science)
		- consists of the formal , disciplined and purely logical parts of the process
		- includes planning, scheduling, controlling projs etc
	- the sociocultural dimenstion (art)
		- involves contradictory and paradoxical world of implementation
		- centers on creating a temporary social sys within a larger org env that combines the talents of a divergent set of pros working to complete the project
	- can be represented as a yin and yang
	- this course is mostly on the technical part of it
	- scope, sbs, schedules, resource allocation, baseline budgets, status reports
## pmo
- proj mgmt office
- is a centralised unit within an org or a dept that oversees and supports the execution of projs
- plays a critical role in helping matrix systems mature into more effective proj delivery platforms
- can be categorised into diff profiles
	- weather station - tracks and monitors proj performance
	- control tower - improves proj performance
	- resource pool - provides the org with a cadre of trained proj managers and pros
	- command and control centre - has direct authority over the proj

## pmbok
- the proj mgmt body of knowledge is a standard
- it provides guidelines and biz processes that relate to key "knowledge areas" that underpin good proj mgmt
- processes are clustered into process grps
- iniating, planning, executing, monitoring, and controlling, and closing
- knowledge areas - scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, commns, risk, procurement, stakeholders, integraion
- this course is designed around pmbok

## prince2
- alt to pmbok
- projects in controlled envs version 2
- it was developed by the UK office of govt commerce
- originally for IT focused project mgmt methodology but it has a wide base usage now
- broad uptake in industry in australia, for it projs
- it is very doc heay and represents a "traditional" approach to proj mgmt
- it has processes that group proj mgmt activities: starting a proj, directing a proj, initiating a proj, controlling a stage, managing prod delivery, managing a stage boundary, closing a proj

## agile techniques
- agile techniques are becoming more popular in proj mgmt
- we will cover them in depth later on 
- differs from trad methods in thtat the scope of the prod/ process being produced by the prj doesnt have to be specified in detail at the start
- the agile team collaborates to deliver the product progressively in short phases called sprints

## high performing teams
- synergy
	- positive synergy 1+1+1+1+1 = 10
	- negative synergy 1-1-1-1-1 = 2
- characteristics of a high performing team
	- share a sense of common purpose
	- make effective use of the individual talents and expertise
	- balance role and share tasks
	- exert energy toward problem solving
	- accept differences of opinion and expression
	- encourage risk taking creativity
	- set high personal performance stds
	- id source of both proff and personal growth
- recruit proj members
	- factors affecting recruitment
		- the importance of the proj
		- the mgmt structure being used to complete the proj
		- considerations that need to be factored in
			- prob solving ability
			- availability
			- tech exp
			- credibility
			- political con
			- ambition, initiative, and energy
			- familiarilty
- 5 stage team development model
	1. forming
	2. storming
	3. norming
	4. performing
	5. adjourning
- conducting team meetings
	- the 1st prj team meeting - proj kick off meeting
	- establishing ground rules
	- planning 
	- tracking
	- managing
	- relationship
	- managing subsequent proj meetings
- establish team norms
	- confidentiality is maintained. no info is shared outside the team unless everyone agrees to it
	- it is acceptable to be in trouble, but its not acceptable to surprise others. tell others immediately when deadlines or milestones will not be met
	- 0 tolerance for bullying
	- agree to disagree, but when a decision has been made, suck it up and move on
	- respect outsiders, and do not flaunt ones position on the team
	- why phy
- managing conflict
	- encouraging functional conflict
		- functional conflict plays a critical role in obtaining a deeper understanding of the issues and coming up with the best decisions
		- proj managers can legitimise dissent within the team by
			- designating a devils advocate
			- asking the group to take 15mins to come up with all the reasons why we shouldnt pursue this course of action
	- how to manage?
		- mediate
		- arbitrate
		- control
		- accept
		- eliminate
- managing virtual proj teams
	- 2 biggest challenges involved in managing a virtual proj team are
		- developing trust
		- developing effective paterns of communication

# week 2

## overview
- scope and the scope checklist
- scope creep
- project priorities
- outsourcing
- rfp's
- contracts

## project initiation
- it is completed at the start of the proj lifecycle
- involves the defn and approval of the project
- stakeholders conduct a kickoff meeting and prepare docs that defines and justifies the proj
	- proj charter - a doc that authorises a proj manager to initiate and lead the proj. it consists of a high lvl desc of the proj
	- biz case - similar to a charter, but it defines and justifies a proj. this doc is central to the PRINCE2 method and is revisited constantly throughout the lifecycle
- if the proj is approved via governance processes, detailed planning can now commence

## defining the proj scope
- proj scope is a defn of the end result or mission of the proj - a product or a service for our customer
- defines the results to be achieved in specific, tangible and measurable ways
- why?
	- to clearly define the deliverables
	- to direct focus on the roj purpose throughout the life of the project for the cust and proj participants
	- to be published and used by the proj owner and proj participants and measuring proj success
- checklist
	- proj obj
	- scope defn
	- justification
	- deliverables
	- milestones
	- tech requirements
	- limits and exclusions
	- acceptance criteria
- scope statement- is a short, 1/2 page summary of key elements of the scope followed by extended document of each element
- scope creep - is the tendency for the proj scope to expand over the time, usually due to changing req, specs and priorities. negative effects, causes more time and effort
- most frequent causes
	- por req analysis
	- not involving users early enough
	- underestimating proj complexity
	- lack of change control
	- gold plating - to do more than what is required

## proj priorities
- 3 major criteria (trade offs) that a proj manager has to manage
	- cost
	- time
	- performance (scope)
	- also called the triple constraint or the iron triangle of proj mgmt, inside the triangle you have the proj quality
	- inter related props, increase/ dec in one prop will prompt changes in another
- proj manager can manage the proj trade offs by completing a priority matrix by the proj and id-ing which criterion is
	- constrain - the original param is fixed
	- enhance - a criterion should be optimised. there is some wiggle room, so you must minimise the time and make the change
	- accept - a criterion is tolerable not to meet the original param, depending on tolerance, decide and accept the change
- priority matrix is a 3x3 matrix
- constrain, enhance, accept on one side
- cost time and performance on the other
- because time to market is imp for sales, the proj manager is instructed to take advantage of every opportunity to reduce completion time
- going over the budget is acceptable, but not desirable
- at the same time, the original perf specs for the modem as well as the reliability stds must not be compromised

## outsourcing
- traditionally has been applied to the transferring of biz fns or processes to other foreign companies
- is now being applied to contracting significant chunks of proj work
	- mobile phone companies outsource other companies for chips
- advantages
	- cost reduction
	- faster completion
	- high level of expertise
	- flexibility
- disadvantages
	- coordination breakdown
	- loss of control
	- conflict
	- security issues
	- political issues

## request for proposal (rfp)
- involves the act of companies bidding to take up a part or the whole project
- you need an rfp to apply for these contracts
- steps of dev of a detailed rfp
	- summary of the needs and request for action
	- statement of work (sow) detailing the scope and major deliverables
	- deliverable specs/req, features, and tasks
	- responsibilities of vendor and cust
	- proj schedule
	- type of contract
	- experience and staffing
	- eval criteria
- how does a contractor evaluate these RFP's
	- must be done in a transparent way
	- there is a checklist where they assign weights/points to each proposal based on certain criteria. can they pull it off? do they have the manpower to do so etc
- best practices while outsourcing
	- well defined req and procedures
	- extensive training and team building activites
	- well established conflict management processes in place
	- freq review and status updates
	- co location when needed
	- fair and incentive laden work
	- long term outsourcing relationship
- the process of securing and procuring outsourcing work is called PROCUREMENT MGMT PROCESS, the RFPs are selected and pitched in this process
	- planning purchases and acquisitions
	- planning contracting
	- req seller responses
	- selecting sellers
	- admin the contract
	- close the contract

## contract
- a formal agreement btw 2 parties, wherein 1 party obligates itself to perform a service and the other party obligates itself to do something in return, usually in the form of payment to the contractor
- where party1 is the contractor, and the party2 is the client
- is a codification of the private law, which governs the rel btw the parties to it
- defines the responsibilities
- defines the rights of the parties have in the relationship to each other
- grants remedies to a party in case the other party breaches its obligations

### fixed price contract
- the contractor agrees to do all the work specified in the contract for a fixed price
- fp contracts are preferred by both owners and contractors when the scope is well defined and the costs are predictable
- and there is low implementation cost
- the disadvantage is that its more diff for the contractor and more costly for them to prepare
- the primary disadvantage is they can underestimate the cost
- contracts with long lead times such as construction and production projects may include escalation provisions that protect the cont against external factors that may affect the cost
- fp incentive fee (fpif)
	- fp is preferred by both when there is high lvl of certainty
	- fpif example: cost estimate - cost = 10000, fee = 1000 => total price = 11000
	- most common type of contract

### cost plus contract
- the contractor is reimbursed for all direct allowable costs plus an additional fee to cover overheads and profit
- unlike fpc, cpc puts the burden on the client
- the contract does not indicate what the proj is going to cost until the very end
- the inherent weakness of cpc has been compensated for by a variety of incentive clauses directed at providing incentives to the contractor to control costs, maintain the perf and avoid schedule delays
- cpc incentive fee (cpif)
	- cpif contracts provides for payment to the contactor on actual costs plus a negotiated fee that is fixed before the work begins, the fee doesnt vary with the costs
	- cpif puts the burden on the client
	- client must exercise external control over the contractors work and make sure external factors dont affect the proj
	- contractors cost sys must be open to the customer

## in class
- proj scope- proj scope is a defn of the end result or mission of the proj - a product or a service for our customer
- checklist. 
	- proj obj
	- scope defn
	- justification (me)
	- deliverables
	- milestones
	- tech requirements
	- limits and exclusions
	- acceptance criteria
- scope creep - is the tendency for the proj scope to expand over the time, usually due to changing req, specs and priorities. negative effects, causes more time and effort
- fpc and cpc

# week 3

## overview 
- work breakdown struct (wbs)
- work packages
- scheduling in ms proj
- developing a schedule

## project planning
- proj planning commences after a proj has been initiated (defined and approved)
- it involves the detailed planning of the proj
- proj stakeholders conduct and prepare a detailed proj plan that centres around a proj schedule
- we will learn about proj planning in the same course

## work breakdown structure
- wbs
- decomposes a proj into a series of related chunks 
- its a hierarchical outline of the proj w diff levels of detail
- ids the products and work elements involved in a proj
- defines the relationship of the final deliverable (the proj) to its sub deliverables, and in turn., their rel to the work packages
- serves as a framework for tracking cost and work performance

### hierarchical breakdown of the wbs
- each element that is produced by this step wise breakdown is arranged into a hierarchy
- there are diff names, diff levels and this is useful for proj managers who are attempting to understand what a project is about, to understand the key areas
- you have the top level which is the project as a whole, and then brainstorm with your team to break this down into smaller and smaller chunks until you get to the bottom of the hierarchy where you end up with a work package

### WBS codes
- these are numbers assigned to every box in the hierarchy and make it easy to manage
- 1.0 is the complete project (top level)
- 1.2 1.3 1.4  - DELIVERABLES are major proj components
- 1.2.1 1.3.1 1.4.2 - SUB DELIVERABLES are supporting deliverables
- 1.2.2.3 1.3.2.2 1.4.1.1 - WORK PACKAGES are individual proj activities

### how wbs helps proj managers
- assures proj managers that all prod and work eles are identified, to integrate the proj with the curr org, and to establish a basis for control
- facilitates the evaluation of cost, time and tech performance at all levels in the org over the life of the proj
- provides mgmt with info appropriate to each org level
- helps project managers to plan, schedule and budget the proj
- helps in the dev of the org breakdown structure (OBS), which assigns proj responsibilues to org units and individuals
- provides the oppo to "roll up" the budget and actual costs of the smaller work packages into larger work elements
- defines comm channels and assists in understanding and coordinating many parts of the project

### work package
- lowest level of the wbs
- is a short duration task that has a definite start and end point, consumes resources and represents cost
- shouldnt exceed 10work days or 1 reporting period
- should be as independent when it comes to other work packages
- basic unit of planning, scheduling and controlling a proj

### each work package
- when you create a schedule, each WP represents some work that has to be done
- has a time associated to it
- cost and resource allocated to each WP
- people are the primary resource we see allocated to this task, as in who is responsible for this task
- identifies the monitoring points for measuring progress

### coding the wbs
- defines the hierarchy of the schedule
- when you look at the diagram, its not obvious straight away
- sometimes, the title of the WP might be ambiguous.
- which is why we define WBS dictionaries
- wbs dicts give detailed info about each element in the wbs

## wbs dict
- generally presented as a table comprising of WBS code, WP and a description of what that task entails
- something like this

| wbs code | task name           | description                                                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.0      | outline the project | this task is designed to outline the project and give some other long description for this task |

## scheduling and ms proj
- once weve identified all the tasks in detail, now we can start scheduling
- there are many proj mgmt s/w but we'll be using ms porj
- a schedule can also be referred to as a timeline or WBS
- it sets out all the work that needs to be done, manage and complete a proj
- in ms proj, the schedule contains the WBS - work package = task
- a schedule is a fundamental tool for a project manager, and its used everyday
- its setup as part of proj planning, and is then used to monitor and control projs once work is underway

### proj scheduling
- use verbs for task names and display WBS codes for ease of use
- chunk tasks into logical groups/phases/stages using summary tasks/ indentation
- use recurring tasks for things that need to be done on a regular basis
- include milestones - tasks with 0 duration to note key dates
- make sure all wok required to develop proj deliverables is captured in the schedule

### getting started
- a proj manager and team members will start with the project scope statement and key docs such as the proj charter and business case
- schedule tasks are then brainstormed based on what the proj must deliver
- getting stakeholders involved will provide diverse perspectives and ensure work isnt overlooked
- the schedule shouldnt be an hour/hour to do list
- it has to be detailed enough that it flags issues to the proj manager
- break it up into smaller tasks so its easy to manage and monitor

### timing and linking tasks
- you can specify the duration in minutes, hours, days or longer
- task dates can be manual or auto scheduled
- tasks can be linked and the sequence of completion is set by entering the predecessors- establishes finish-to-start FS link
- many rels that we can use to link tasks and any ways to setup these links
- 6 fields are used to compile the initial schedule
	- WBS code
	- task name
	- duration
	- start
	- end
	- predecessors

## linkedin learning

### section 1


## in class discussion
- wbs - a deliverbae orientaed hierarchial decomposisiton of the work to be executed by the projet team to accomplish the project objectives and create the reqired deliverables
- from a wbs point of view, what all do you need to do?
	- proj plan, scope work, plan resources, plan materials
- proj schedule is a detailed plan that outlines 
- min 20tasks in the shcedule, atleast 35 tasks

# week 4

## overview
- assigning resources
- proj estimates
- porj costs
- resource sheet and cash flow report

## resources and costs
- res are the things you need to complete tasks, produce deliverables and complete the proj
- typically, they are people (hr) and materials (concrete ,servers)
- in our last lecture, we focused on the wbs and a schedule
	- a schedule is not complete until resources are assigned
- this week, we will examine estimation techniques, resourcing and cost - key eles of proj planning

## assigning proj work
- reasons why we should not always assign the best people the most diff tasks
	- best people - resent the fact that theyre always given diff tasks
	- less exp participants: resent the fact that they are never given a chance to expand their skill set
- factors to consider when deciding who should work together
	- minimise unnecessary tension: complement each other
	- exp: veterans team up with new hires
	- future needs: have people work together early on so that they can become familiar with each other

## proj estimation
### estimation defined
- is the process of forecasting or approximating the time and cost of completing proj deliverables
- is a trade off, balancing the benefits of better accuracy against the costs of secured increased accuracy
### types of estimates
- top down (macro) - analogy, group consensus, or math rels
- bottom up (micro) - based on estimates of eles in the wbs

### why make estimates in the first place
- est are needed to supprot good decisions
- needed to schedule work
- needed to determine how long the proj should take and its cost
- to develop cash flow needs
- to determine how well the proj is progressing
- whether the proj is worth doing

### factors affecting quality of estimates
- planning horizon
	- est duratiion of the proj we're planning
	- much easier to develop costs and est for a proj that have short term planning horixons ie, that projs dont extend beyond 6mos into the future
- proj complexity
- people
- proj structure and org
- padding est
- org culture
- other factors

### estimating guidelines for time, cost and resources
- responsibility
- the use of several people to estimate
- normal conditions
- time units
- independance
- contingencies
- risk assessmet added to the estimate to avoid surprises to stakeholders

### topdown vs bottomup estimating
#### topdown
- are usually derived from someone who uses exp and or info to determine the proj duration and total cost
- are sometimes made by top managers who have vert little knowledge of the component activites used to complete the proj

#### bottomup
- can take place after the proj has been defined in detail
- can serve as a check on cost elements in the WBS by rolling up the work packages and associated cost accounts to majot delieverables
- provide the customers with an oppo to compare the low cost, efficient method approach with any imposed restructions

#### when to use
- topdown
	- when dealing with more strategic decisions
- bottomup
	- when cost and time are important and customer needs an indepth breakdown of costs

### preferred approach in defining proj
- make a rough top down estimate
- develop the wbs
- make the bottom up estimates
- develop schedule and budgets
- reconcile the diff btw topdown and bottomup est

### topdown and bottomup est
- cheaper to make topdown est
- bottomup is labour intensive
- only commit to bottom up if you have the resources otherwise it may cost more to plan than to develop the proj
- accuracy for topdown is more than bottomup

### level of detail
- the level of detai in the wbs varies with
	- the complexity of the proj
	- the need for control
	- the proj size, cost, duration and other factors
- excessive detail
	- emphasizes departmental outcomes rather than delievrable outcomes
	- creates more unproductuve paperwork
- inadequate deyail
	- fails short of meeting the structures needs

## types of costs
### direct costs
- are clearly chargeable to a specific work package
	- labout, materials, equipment etc
### direct proj overhead costs
- can be tied to proj deliverables or work packages
	- ex: slary of the proj manager, temporary rental space, supplies, specialised machinery
### general  and administrative (g&a) overhead costs
- are not directly linked to a specific proj
	- advertising, accounting, salary of senior managemet above the proj level

## refining estimates
- reasons for adjusting estimates
	- interaction cost are hidden in estimates
	- normal conditions dont apply
	- things go wrong in projs
	- proj scope and plans change
	- people are overly optimistic
	- people engage in strategic misrepresentation

## mega projects
- large scale complex ventures that typically cost 1bn or more, take many years to complete and involve many priv and public stakeholders
	- ex: high speed rail lines etc
- often involve a "double whammy"
	- proj cost much more than expected and under deliver on benefits the proj were to provide
- are sometimes referred to a "white elephant"
	- proj are over budget and uner value and the costs of maintaining the proj exceed the benefits recvd

## reference class forecasting
- how can we avoid proj failure?
- 3 major steps
	- select a reference class of projs similar to your potential proj
	- collect and arrange outcome as a distribution. create a dist of cost overruns as a percentage of the original proj estimate
	- use the distribution data to arrive at a realistic forecast. compare the original cost estimate for the proj with the ref class projects
- benefits?
	- outside empirical data mitigates human bias
	- politics, strategic, and promoter forces have difficulty ignoring outside RCF info
	- serves as a reality cehck for funding large projects
	- helps executives avoid unsound optimism
	- leads to improved accountability
	- provides a basis of proj contingency funds

## resources and cost in ms project
- a schedule is not complete until resources are assigned
- through ms porj we can use bottom up approach to estiate and assign resources to tasks in our schedule
- once resourcing is complete, we can generate a cash flow report to visualise proj costs

## resource types
- **work** - cost based on duration of allocation.typically, a person or equipment that is used for a period of time
- **material** - cost is calculated based on quantity consumed
- **cost** - other costs that arent calculated based on time or quantity such as travel expenses ($ amount is assigned to a task rather than in the resource sheet)
- to assign reources we must specify them in the resource sheet first

## cash flow report
- costs can be visualised using ms proj
- we will use the cash flow report this sem
- the cash flow repo should be customised so that it's meaningful (eg: remove redundant default info such as cost variance and remaining cost from the report title so that the end result looks professional)
- update all sections of the report and remove the prompts from textbox area in the template
## questions to ask
- do i have to explicitly mention (MILESTONE: Verify blah blah blah?
- can we have a set of actions that we call recursively because in the end it is the same task in a different location
- costs of their labour? (ethan)
## in class notes
- create a res sheet only when the schedule is done
- im in charge of MATERIAL RESOURCE COSTS IN THE RESOURCE SHEET

# week 5

## overview
- nw diagrams
- critical path
- constraints

## proj nw
- its an alternate way to showing the wbs or proj schedule
- its a graphical flow chart depicting the proj activities that must be completed, the logical sequences, the interdependencies of the activities to be completed, and the times for the activities to start and finish along with the longest path through the nw- the critical path
- provides the basis for scheduling labour and equipment
- enhances com btw proj stakeholders
- provides an estimate for proj duration
- provides the basis for budgeting the cash flow
- identifies which activities are "critical" and shouldnt be delayed
- highlights which activities to consider for compressing the proj duration
- helps managers get and stay on proj plan

## constructing a proj nw

### terminologies
- activity: an element of the proj that requires time but may not require resources
- parallel activities: activities that can take place at the same time, if needed
- burst activity: an activity that has more than 1 activity immediately following it (more than one dependency from it)
- merge activity: an activity that has more than one activity immediately preceding it
- path: a sequence of connected dependant activities
- critical path: the path with the longest duration through the nw

### 2 approaches
- activity on node (AON)
	- uses a node to depict an activity
	- preferred approach
- activity on arrow (AOA)
	- uses an arrow to depict an activity

### basic rules to follow
- nws flow from l -> r
- an activity cannot begin until all preceding connected activities have been completed
- arrows on nws indicate precedent and flow and can cross over each other
- each activity should have a unique id number
- an activity id no must be greater than that of any activity that precedes it
- no looping
- no conditional statements
- where there are multiple starts, a common start node can be used to indicate a clear proj beginning on the nw, just like that, a single proj end node can be used to indicate a clear ending

## why analyse a nw? the critical path
- the critical path is the path that has the least slack in common
	- slack is the amount of time an activity can be delayed and not delay the proj
- its the longest path through the activity nw
- shortest expected time in which the entire proj can be completed
- is imp because it impacts completion time
- you put your best people on here
- you pay extra when doing risk assessment here
- where you dont look when other managers are asking to "borrow" people or equipment
- where you dont look when you dont have time to monitor all activities

## sensitivity
- nw sensitivity is the likelihood that the original critical path will change once the proj is initiated
- a nw schedule that has only one critical path and non critical activities that enjoy significatn slack would be labelled "INSENSITIVE"

## nw computation process - calculating critical path

### forward pass - earliest times
- how soon can the activity start (early start - ES)
- how soon can the act finish (early finish - EF)
- how soon can the proj finish (expected time - TE)
### backward pass - latest times
- how late can the act start (late start - LS)
- how late can the act finsih (late finish - LF)
- how long can the act be delayed (slack or float - SL)

### determining slack
#### total slack
- tells us the amount of time an activity can be delayed and not delay the proj
- how long an activity can exceed its early finish date without affecting the proj end date or an imposed completion date
- is simply the diff between the LS and ES

#### free slack
- is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying any immediately following act
- how long an activity can exceed its early finish date without affecting the ES dates of any of its successors
- allows flexibility in scheduling scarce resources
- occurs only activity at the end of a chain of activities, here you only have a merge act

## overview of the resource scheduling prob

### resources and priorities
- proj nw times are not a schedule until res have been assigned
	- there are always more proj proposals than there are available res
	- the proj priority team will add a new proj only if resources are avlb
- cost est are not a budget until they have been time-phased
	- once res assignment has been finalised, you are able to develop a baseline budget schedule for the proj
### resource smoothing (levelling)
- involves attempting to even out varying demands on res by delaying non critical act (using slack)
- this lowers peak res demand and thus increases res utilisation when res are adequate over the life of the proj

### resource-constrained scheduling
- occurs when resources are not adequate to meet peak demands
- the late start of some activities must be delayed, and the duration of the proj may be increased

## types of proj constraints
- technical/ logical constraints
	- are related to the nw'd sequence in which proj activities must occur
- res constraints
	- occur when the absence, shortage, or unique inter relationship and interaction characteristics of res require a particular sequencing of proj activities
	- note that the res dep takes priority over the technological dependency but does not violate the technological dependency
- types of res constraints
	- people
	- materials
	- equipment

## classification of a schedule problem

### time constrained proj
- must be completed by an imposed date
- time is fixed and res are flexible. if req, res can be added to ensure proj is completed by a specific date

### res constrained proj
- assumes the level of res available cannot be exceeded
- res are fixed and time is flexible. if the re are inadequate, it will be acceptable to delay the proj
- consult a proj priority matrix to determine if the proj is time or res constrained

### limiting assumptions
- splitting activities will not be allowed
	- refers to interrupting work on 1 task and assigning the res to work on a diff task for a period of time, then reassigning them to work on the orig task
- level of res used for an activity cannot be changed

### risk assumptions
- activities with the most slack pose the least risk
- reduction of flexibility does not increase risk
- the nature of an activity doesnt increase risk

## time constrained projs
- must be completed by an imposed date
- focs on resource util
- require use of resource smoothing techniques that balance demand for a resource

### smoothing techniques
- delay noncritical activities by using positive slack to reduce peak demand and fill in the valleys for the resource without delaying the entire proj

### goals of smoothing res demand
- reduce the peak of demand for the resource
- reduce the no: of resources over the life of the proj
- minimise the fluctuation in res demand

### downside of smoothing res demand
- loss of flexi that occurs from reducing slack
- creates more critical acts and/or near noncritical acts because of slack reduction

## res constrained projs
- res are limited in quantity or avlb
- acts are scheduled using HEURISTICS by following the priority rules
	- min slack
	- smallest (least) duration
	- lowest act id number
- the parallel method is an iterative process that starts from the beginning of proj time and when the res needed exceed the res avlb, retains acts first by the periority rules

### impacts of res contrained scheduling
- reduces slack, reduces flexi
- increases the no: of critical and near critical acts
- increases scheduling complexi bcoz res constraints are added to tech constraints
- may make the traditional critical path no longer meaningful
- can break the seq and leave the nw with a set of disjoint crit acts
- may cause parallel acts to be sequential
- can change activities from crit to noncrit

# week 6

## objectives
- risk and risk mgmt
- the risk mgmt process
	- risk assessment
	- risk response matrix
- change control

## risk mgmt process
- what is risk?
	- an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs, has a +ve or -Ve effect on proj objectives
- no amount of planning can overcome or control risk
- what is risk mgmt?
	- an attempt to recognize and manage potential and unforeseen trouble spots that may occur when the proj is implemented
	- what can go wrong? (risk event)
	- how to minimise risk events (consequences)
	- what can be done before the event occurs (anticipation)
	- what to do when an event occurs (contingency)
- it can be observed that the chances of risk decreases as the project lifecycles comes towards the end
- as we move forwards, more info emerges, were more comfy with the team and so we're more certain fixing these issues confidently
- the cost however increases as the lifecycle moves on and this is because it gets more costly to reverse and rectify existing code

## benefits of risk mgmt
- a proactive rather than reactive approach
- reduces surprises and -ve consequences
- preparesthe proj manager to take the appropriate action
- provides better control over the future
- improves the chances of reaching proj objective on time, within budget and of meeting req performance

## 4 key steps 
1. risk id
2. risk assessment
3. risk response dev
4. risk res control
- well only focus on 1-3

### risk id
- generate a list of all the possible risks that could affect the proj through brainstorming and other prob id-ing techniques
- focus on the events that could produce consequences, not on proj obj
- use risk breakdown structure (rbs) in conjunction with wbs to id and analyse risks
- id the macro risks that first then specific areas can be checked
- use risk profile (a list of q's) to address traditional areas of uncertainty on a proj

### rbs
- top level is the proj
- then were breaking it down into areas that may have risk associated with them
- then we break those areas further

## risk assessment
- scenario analysis: assesses the significance of each risk event in terms of prob and impact
- risk assessment form evaluates the severity, prob of risk events and its detection difficulty
- risk severity matrix prioritises which risks to address
	- failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) extends the risk severity matrix by including ease of detection into the equation
	- risk value = impact * prob * detection
- prob analysis uses stat techniques in assessing period risk
	- decisiion trees, not present values, prog evaludation and review technique (PERT) and PERT simulation

### defined conditions for impact scales of a risk on major proj objs

| obj     | 1 very low                   | 2 low                                 | 3 moderate                          | 4 high                                  | 5 very high                             |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| cost    | insiginifcat cost increase   | `<10%` cost inc                         | 10-20% cost inc                     | 20-40% cost inc                         | `>40%` cost inc                           |
| time    | insignificant time increase  | `<5%` time inc                          | 5-10% time inc                      | 10-20% time inc                         | `>20%` time inc                          |
| scope   | scope dec barely noticable   | minor areas of scope affected         | major areas of scope affected       | scope reduction unacceptable to sponsor | project and item is effectively useless |
| quality | degradation barely noticable | only very demanding apps are affected | reduction requires sponsor approval | unacceptable to sponsor                 | effectively useless                     |

### risk assessment form

| risk event | likelihood | impact | detection difficulty | when |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------ | -------------------- | ---- |
|            |            |        |                      |      |
our risk assessment template also includes value
risk value = impact * prob * detection

### risk severity matrix
- it allows proj managers to visualise the risk

## risk res dev
- mitigating risk
	- reducing the likelihood that the event will occur
	- reducing the impact that the adverse event would have on the proj
- avoiding risk
	- changing the proj plan to eliminate the risk or condition
- transferring risk
	- passing the risk to another party
- escalating risk
	- notifying the appropriate people within the og of the threat
- retaining risk
	- making a conscious decision to accept the risk of an event occuring

## contingency planning
- what is contingency plan
	- its an alternative plan that will be used if a possible foreseen risk event becomes a reality
	- its a plan of action that will reduce or mitigate the -ve impact of the risk event
	- is not a part of the initial implementation plan and only goes into effect after the risk is recognized
- risks of the absence of a contingency plan
	- cause a manager to delay or postpone the decision to implemetn a remedy
	- lead to panic and acceptance of the 1st remedy
	- make the decision under pressure which can be dangerous and costly

### risk res matrix

| risk event | response | contingency plan | trigger | who is responsible |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
|            |          |                  |         |                    |

## risk and contingency planning
- technical risks
	- backup strategies if chosen tech fails
	- assess whether tech uncertainties can be resolved
- schedule risks
	- expedite or "crash" the proj to get it back on track
	- shcedule activities in parallel or use start to start lag rels
	- use the best people fr high risk tasks
- cost risks
	- review the price to avoid the trap of using one lumpsum to cover price risks
- funding risks
	- eval the risk of reductions in funding - a cut in the proj

## opportunity mgmt
- an opp is an event that can have +ve impact on proj objectives
- exploit
	- seek to eliminate the uncertainty associated with an opportunity to ensure that it definetely happens
- share
	- allocate some or all of the ownership of an opportunity to another party who is bes able to capture the oppo for the benefit of the proj
- enhance
	- take action to increase the prob and/or the +ve impact of an oppo
- escalate
	- notify the appropriate people within the org of the oppo
- accept
	- be willing to take advantage of the oppo if it occurs but not taking action to pursue it

## contin funding and time buffers
- contingency funds
	- funds to cover proj risks - id'ed and unkown
	- for control purposes, contin funds are divided into
		- contin reserves - cover id's risks and alocated to specific sgments or deliverables of the proj
		- mgmt reserves - cover unidentified risks and are allocated to risks associated with the total proj
- time buffers
	- are amount of time used to cushion against potential delays in the proj
		- add to activities with severe risks
		- add to merge activities that are prone to delays
		- add to noncritical acts to reduce the likeliook that they will create another crti path
		- add to activites that req scarce resources

## risk res control
- risk register
	- details all the id'd risks, incl description, categry, prob, impact, res, contin plans, owners, and status
- risk control involves
	- executng the risk res strategy
	- monitoring triggering activities
	- initiating contin plans
	- watching for new risks
- establishing a change mgmt sys
	- monitoring, tracking and reporting risks
	- fostering an open org env
	- repeating risk id/assessment excercises
	- assigning and doc res for managing risk

## change ctrl mgmt
- sources of change
	- proj scope changes
	- implementation of contin plans
	- improvement changes
- cms
	- id proposed changes
	- list expected effects of proposed changes on schedule and budget
	- review eval and approve/disapprove of changes formally
	- negotiate and resolve conflicts of change, conditions and cost
	- communicate changes to parties affected
	- adjust the master schedule adnd budget
	- track all changes that are to be implemented

### benefits of cms
- inconsequential changes are discouraged by the formal process
- cost of changes are maintainedin a log
- integiry of wbs and perf measures is maintained
- allocation and sue of contin and mgmt reserves are tracked
- effect of changes is visible to all parties involved
- implementation of change is monitored
- scope changes will be quickly reflected in baseline and perf measures

## ask
- are things not in our control a technical risk? like bugs in the DIY software, wifi at the centre etc
- risks tied up with critical tasks
- centre appointed diy trainer
- do we have to account for costs that the centre would also pay?
