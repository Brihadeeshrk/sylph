# Smart Stack

Widgets show up automatically based on time, location and more. Like if rain is coming. Live Activities are now supported on Apple Watch and appear in the Smart Stack. So you can stay on top of the latest sport scores or know when your Uber is about to arrive.

Brand-new widgets include severe weather alerts, Training load, Photos, Distance and Shazam. And you can directly access three items you used most recently in an app — like your three most recent Workout types or songs you’ve played.
