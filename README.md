### Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the development server. Once the server is running, you can view your portfolio at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Scripts

The following scripts are available to help you manage development, build processes, and linting:

**`build`**

Runs the linting process, updates MDX file timestamps, and then builds the Next.js application for production. This ensures code quality and proper SEO metadata before deployment.

```bash
pnpm build
```

**`postbuild`**

Automatically generates the sitemap after the build process completes. This script uses the `next-sitemap` package to create a `sitemap.xml` file for better SEO and discoverability.

```bash
pnpm postbuild
```

**`mdx:timestamps`**

Runs a custom Node.js script that updates timestamps (`created` and `updated`) in your MDX files, automating the time management for blog posts.

```bash
pnpm mdx:timestamps
```

**`lint:style`**

Runs `stylelint` on all CSS files to check and automatically fix any style issues. This ensures consistent and clean CSS code.

```bash
pnpm lint:style
```

**`lint:biome`**
Runs the Biome linter to check and fix JavaScript/TypeScript code. This keeps your codebase clean and error-free.

```bash
pnpm lint:biome
```

**`lint:prettier`**

Runs Prettier to format your code according to your project's style guide. This improves code readability and consistency.

```bash
pnpm lint:prettier
```

**`lint`**

A combination of the style, Prettier, and Biome linting scripts, run together to ensure the entire codebase follows consistent style and format rules.

```bash
pnpm lint
```
